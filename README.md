# android-ultrasound-gesture
The project objective is to recognize various gestures using only ultrasound by applying Fast Fourier Transforms
and machine learning (SVMs) and reach a good level of accuracy in recognizing hand gestures in mobile devices,
at the end we aim to be able to recognize 4 gestures (towards and away from the device using only signal processing)
with high accuracy two more gestures (Swipe left and swipe right) can be easily interpreted by giving them as input to SVM.
